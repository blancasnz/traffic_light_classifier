# traffic_light_classifier

This was the final project for my Udacity Intro To Self Driving Cars nanodegree program.  We were challenged with creating
a traffic light classifier by implementing features that could detect red, yellow, and green lights.  An extensive 
description of the project can be found here: [Traffic Light Classifier Project](https://github.com/helloart3mis/traffic_light_classifier/blob/master/home/Traffic_Light_Classifier.ipynb)!
